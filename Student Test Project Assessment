# Student Test Project Assessment: Data Modeling, Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Project Overview
In this project, you will work with a dataset of student test scores to build a data model, clean the data, and transform it using the concepts of data modeling, DAX, and Power BI functions learned in class.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset contains student test results from multiple classes. It includes the following columns:

- **StudentID**: A unique identifier for each student.
- **StudentName**: The name of the student.
- **Class**: The class or section the student belongs to.
- **Subject**: The subject for which the test was conducted.
- **TestDate**: The date the test was taken.
- **Score**: The score obtained by the student.
- **MaxScore**: The maximum score possible for the test.

### Objective:
You are required to:
1. Clean and transform the data to remove errors and inconsistencies.
2. Create a data model to enable analysis of student performance.
3. Use DAX to perform calculations such as the average score, total score, and pass/fail status.
4. Build visualizations to present key insights from the dataset.

## Step 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation

### Tasks:
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Identify missing values in the `StudentName`, `TestDate`, and `Score` columns.
   - Replace missing values in the `StudentName` with "Unknown" and in the `Score` with 0.

   ```dax
   CleanedData = IF(ISBLANK([StudentName]), "Unknown", [StudentName])
